### Table of the Protypes: 

| Task | Prototype | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | `void reset_to_98(int *n);` | Takes a pointer to an int and updates the value it points to to 98. |
| 1 | `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);` | Swaps the values of two integers. |
| 2 | `int _strlen(char *s);` | Returns the length of a string. |
| 3 | `void _puts(char *str);` | Prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. |
| 4 | `void print_rev(char *s);` | Prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line. |
| 5 | `void rev_string(char *s);` | Reverses a string. |
| 6 | `void puts2(char *str);` | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. |
| 7 | `void puts_half(char *str);` | Prints the second half of a string. If the number of characters is odd, prints the last n characters, where n = (length_of_the_string + 1) / 2. |
| 8 | `void print_array(int *a, int n);` | Prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. The numbers must be separated by commas, followed by a space. |
| 9 | `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);` | Copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. |
| 10 | `int _atoi(char *s);` | Converts a string to an integer. |
