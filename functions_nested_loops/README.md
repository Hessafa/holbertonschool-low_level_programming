## Functions_Nested_Loops

### Description

We dive deep into the world of nested loops, functions, and header files in C! This project is like learning to juggle with multiple balls at once: mastering the art of nested loops while simultaneously understanding the importance of function prototypes and header files.

### Learning Objectives

- **Nested Loops:** What they are, how to use them, and when to apply them.
- **Functions:** What functions are, how to use them, and why they’re crucial for writing clean and efficient code.
- **Function Declarations vs. Definitions:** What the difference is between declaring a function and defining it.
- **Prototypes:** Why prototypes exist and how they help in function declarations.
- **Scope of Variables:** Understanding where and how variables are accessible in C.
- **GCC Flags:** What `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89` flags are and why they are essential in compiling with GCC.
- **Header Files:** What they are and how to use them with `#include` to streamline code and avoid repetition.

### 🛠️ Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Newline:** All files should end with a new line.
- **README.md:** This file is mandatory at the root of the folder.
- **Betty Style:** Code should adhere to the Betty style, checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables:** No global variables allowed.
- **Function Limits:** No more than 5 functions per file.
- **No Standard Library:** No use of standard functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- **_putchar:** You are allowed to use `_putchar`, but **don’t** push your own `_putchar.c` file as it will not be used.
- The **prototypes** of all functions and the prototype of `_putchar` must be included in your header file `main.h`.


## Tasks

In this project, I will create and implement multiple tasks related to **nested loops**, **functions**, and **header files** to strengthen my C programming skills.



### Table of the Protypes were given:

| **Task**                     | **Function Prototype**             | **Description** |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **1. Print Alphabet**         | `void print_alphabet(void);`        | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. |
| **2. Print Alphabet 10 Times**| `void print_alphabet_x10(void);`    | Prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, each followed by a new line. |
| **3. Check for Lowercase**    | `int _islower(int c);`              | Checks if the character `c` is lowercase. Returns 1 if true, 0 otherwise. |
| **4. Check for Alphabetic Character** | `int _isalpha(int c);`        | Checks if the character `c` is an alphabetic letter (lowercase or uppercase). Returns 1 if true, 0 otherwise. |
| **5. Print Sign of a Number** | `int print_sign(int n);`            | Prints the sign of the number `n`. Returns 1 and prints `+` if `n > 0`, returns 0 and prints `0` if `n == 0`, returns -1 and prints `-` if `n < 0`. |
| **6. Absolute Value**         | `int _abs(int);`                    | Computes and returns the absolute value of the integer `n`. |
| **7. Print Last Digit**       | `int print_last_digit(int);`        | Prints and returns the value of the last digit of the integer `n`. |
| **8. Jack Bauer Time**        | `void jack_bauer(void);`            | Prints every minute of the day from 00:00 to 23:59, starting from 00:00, showing hours and minutes. |
| **9. Times Table**            | `void times_table(void);`           | Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. |
| **10. Add Two Integers**      | `int add(int a, int b);`            | Adds two integers `a` and `b` and returns the result. |
| **11. Print n Times Table**   | `void print_times_table(int n);`    | Prints the `n` times table, starting with 0, but only if `n` is between 0 and 15, inclusive. |
