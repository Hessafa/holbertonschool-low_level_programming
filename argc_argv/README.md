# C - argc, argv
## Description

In this project, I explored how to handle command-line arguments in C using `argc` and `argv`. The main goal was to understand how programs can receive input from the terminal, how to process that input, and how to manage unused parameters in the `main` function. This project focused on using various techniques like the `__attribute__((unused))` and `(void)` to handle unused variables.

### Learning Objectives

- Explain how to use arguments passed to a program in C.
- Discuss the two prototypes of the `main` function, and understand when to use one over the other.
- Use the `__attribute__((unused))` attribute or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Resources

- Arguments to main
- `argc` and `argv`
- What does `argc` and `argv` mean?
- How to compile with unused variables

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file must be included at the root of the folder.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style, and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The prototypes of all your functions, as well as the `_putchar` function, should be included in your header file `main.h`.
- The standard library can be used in this project, but other libraries should be avoided.

## Tasks

In this project, we worked on implementing several tasks related to handling command-line arguments, ensuring the use of proper techniques, and compiling C programs correctly.
